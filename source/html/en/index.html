        <h2>Merchant Terms of Use</h2>

        <p>These Merchant Terms of Use (“the Terms”) govern your use of the products, services or any other features, technologies or functionalities (the “Services”) provided by Coinduck   (Coinduck, we, our, or us) through Coinduck’s website, API or through any other means. The terms “you” and “your” refer to the merchant to which we will be providing the Services and the person signing below or otherwise agreeing to the Terms on behalf of the merchant. Please read the Terms carefully; by using the Services, you agree to the Terms and confirm that you accept them.</p>

        <h3>1. The Services</h3>
        <p>We are a cryptocurrency payment processor. We enable you to accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services, and process cryptocurrency payments that you receive from your customer(Purchaser). We are not a crypto exchange, wallet, or a place to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies. Our Services are only available to businesses that sell a product or services or to registered charitable organizations that accept donations. By using the Services, you authorize us to act as your agent so we</p>
        <p>may receive, hold and disburse funds on your behalf and to take any and all actions that we think are necessary to provide the Services and to comply with applicable law. Payment by Purchaser to Coinduck will be considered the same as payment made directly to you and will extinguish the Purchaser’s outstanding obligation, to the extent of the payment.</p>

        <h3>2. Registration</h3>
        <h4>2.1 Generally</h4>
        <p>In order to use the Services, you must open a Coinduck account. When you open an account, we will ask you for contact information such as your name, phone number, email address, and information relating to the ultimate beneficial owner or the most senior individual from the organization. We will also ask you for information on your business, including your business’s legal name or DBA, physical address of the business, and your company’s website. The information that you provide at the time of account opening must be accurate and complete and you must inform us within ten business (10) days of any changes to such information. We may require additional information from you (including any person signing below or otherwise agreeing to the Terms on behalf of the merchant) to help verify your identity and assess your business risk, such as your date of birth, tax identification number, or government-issued identification. We may also obtain information about you from third parties, such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. We have the right to reject your account registration or to later close your Coinduck account, if you do not provide us with accurate, complete, and satisfactory information.</p>

        <p>As a regulated business, Coinduck is required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires Coinduck to verify merchant identities, maintain records of currency transactions for up to five years (New York merchant’s records are held for seven years) and report certain transactions. In the event that a merchant account is closed by Coinduck or at the request of the merchant, even without completing the onboarding process or performing a transaction, records must be held as prescribed by law.</p>

        <p>Merchant Tiers. Coinduck imposes daily transaction processing limits on merchants. When you register for a Coinduck account, you will be required to select the limit (“the Tier”) that will apply to your Coinduck account, and to provide us with the documentation necessary to qualify for that Tier. For certain industries, Coinduck may ask for additional verification documents. We will not begin to process payments on your behalf until we have reviewed the documentation that you provide, in accordance with applicable law. If you wish to change to a Tier with a higher limit, you must provide us with the</p>
        <p>additional required documentation. We will not approve your request to change Tiers and permit you a greater processing volume unless and until we have reviewed your documentation to our satisfaction.</p>

        <p>Please also refer to Section 3.1, Daily Transaction Volume Limits.</p>

        <h4>2.2 Guarding your Password</h4>
        <p>You will choose a password when registering your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account access information. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur with the use of your password or account. Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. If you share your password with others we will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. You may not allow other merchants to use your account. You may not use anyone else’s password at any time.</p>

        <h3>3. Your Sales</h3>
        <h4>3.1 Daily Transaction Volume Limits</h4>
        <p>Coinduck imposes daily and annual transaction processing limits on merchants. When you register for a Coinduck account, you will be enabled to transact at the Basic Tier level. At Coinduck’s discretion, and based on Coinduck’s risk assessment of your business, transaction capabilities may not be enabled until additional documentation or information regarding you and your business is collected and verified.</p>
        <p>Requests to increase your processing limit will not be approved unless and until we have reviewed your documentation to our satisfaction and have confirmed the accuracy and authenticity of the information therein.</p>

        <h4>3.2 Invoices and Records</h4>
        <p>You must keep all records needed for fulfilling the goods or services sold to the Purchaser and providing any post-sale support to the Purchaser. If the sale of the item requires any government registration of the sale, you are responsible for such registration. Coinduck is required to maintain records of all documentation and information collected for your merchant account for the duration that your account is active, and up to 5 years thereafter.</p>

        <h4>3.3 Customer Verification</h4>
        <p>Consistent with your local laws and regulations, you are solely responsible for obtaining any information required of those who purchase your goods or services. For instance, if applicable law prohibits a sale to persons under the age of 18 years, you must ensure that a Purchaser is at least 18 years of age. Similarly, if applicable law requires that a Purchaser’s identity be verified, you must verify the Purchaser’s identity. We will not be responsible for your failure to adequately verify your Purchasers’ identities or qualifications.</p>

        <h3>7. Advertising</h3>
        <p>By written mutual consent, we may publish your corporate name, artwork, text and logo (Merchant Content) on the Coinduck website and promotional materials to acknowledge you as our customer. You represent and warrant to us that you have the right to provide the Merchant Content to us, and that the use, copying, modification and publication of the Merchant Content by us: (a) will not infringe, violate or misappropriate any third party copyright, patent, trade secret or other proprietary rights, (b) will not infringe any rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) will not be defamatory or obscene or otherwise violate any law.</p>

        <h3>8. Invoices & Settlement</h3>
        <h4>8.1 Invoice Generation and Exchange Rate Guarantee</h4>
        <p>Coinduck’s hosted invoice UI shall be used. To create an invoice for your Purchaser, you may post a request to Coinduck to collect a specific amount in your local currency, such as Dollars or Euros, or in any of the supported cryptocurrencies. Coinduck will pull the exchange rate, where applicable, and provide the payment instructions to you for you to display to the Purchaser. For more information about how Coinduck calculates the exchange rates and factors in market depth, please refer to Coinduck.com/exchange-rates. We guarantee the exchange rate to you as long as the Purchaser pays within the proper time window after the invoice is created. Invoice timeout information is clearly displayed on each Coinduck invoice. While we guarantee the exchange rate as long as the Purchaser pays within such time window, you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your local currency or the applicable cryptocurrency. For instance, if you ask us to collect $150, and the Purchaser sends the cryptocurrency equivalent within the time window, we guarantee you will receive exactly $150, minus our fee if applicable. We do not, however, guarantee the value of the U.S. dollar.</p>

        <p>For any payments that are made using the bitcoin blockchain, an invoice is considered complete by us after the payment has six (6) block confirmations. You have the option to inform your Purchaser earlier about the status of the invoice; please note that Coinduck is not liable for settling invoices with a payment that never receives six (6) block confirmations. Coinduck employs techniques to detect payments that are at risk of never receiving six (6) bitcoin block confirmations, however these measures do not completely eliminate the risk associated with unconfirmed payments.</p>

        <h4>8.2 Fees</h4>
        <h5>8.2.1 Merchant Fees</h5>
        <p>We charge service fees for merchants on our Starter Plan who have processed more than thirty transactions in a month or who have selected our Business or Enterprise plans (“Service Fees”). Merchants paying Service Fees will have these fees offset against their applicable ledger balances. If you issue a full or partial refund to your customers, the miner fee amount will be deducted from your merchant ledger balance. The deduction will be added as a separate entry in your Coinduck ledger</p>
        <p>after the refund is executed.</p>

        <h5>8.2.2 Purchaser Fees</h5>
        <h6>Network Costs</h6>
        <p>Coinduck may incur a cost (“Network Cost”) to sweep an incoming cryptocurrency payment. These Network Costs are included in the invoice total and are paid by the Purchaser. The Network Costs are not returned when a refund is executed. Purchaser has the discretion to decide to pay or not an invoice after it has been created.</p>

        <h6>Miner Fees</h6>
        <p>Cryptocurrency transactions may require a miner fee. These miner fees are automatically created by the Purchaser’s wallet and sent to the miner. These miner fees are not Coinduck fees. The miner fees paid to the Network are not returned when a refund is executed.</p>

        <p>If a Purchaser would like to learn more about the applicable fees, please view our payment fee details. We reserve the right to change our fee structure and pricing. Your continued use of the Services after we notify you of any changes in our fees constitutes your acceptance of such change.</p>

        <h4>8.3 Methods of Settlement</h4>
        <p>We will verify the Purchaser’s payments over the cryptocurrency peer-to-peer payment network and post the balance to your accounting ledger, according to your preference settings. The debits and credits to your accounting ledger are funds temporarily held by Coinduck until settlement to your bank account can take place. You can receive a settlement in your local currency, in any of the supported cryptocurrencies, or in a mixture of both. You assume volatility risks of the currency in which you choose to settle. For example, if you choose to settle in bitcoin, then you assume the volatility risk of the bitcoin value. DISCLOSURE: While there are also material risks from accepting various forms of payment (such as cash, other fiat currencies, network card payments, other proprietary electronic payments and alternative virtual currency payments including Litecoin and Dogecoin), Coinduck is disclosing the following material risks of virtual currency.</p>

        <p>Material Risks of Virtual Currency Disclosure Based on 23 NYCCR 200.19:</p>
        <h5>8.3.1 Settlements in Local Currencies</h5>
        <p>If you wish to receive direct deposit settlements, you must provide us with valid bank account information and keep such information current. If you are using the Business or Enterprise plan, we will send a direct deposit to your bank account to clear out your accumulated ledger balance each business day. If you are using the Starter plan, we will settle the accumulated ledger balance on a weekly basis. If you are accepting any portion of yoursettlement in a supported cryptocurrency, we</p>
        <p>will settle to your wallet on a daily basis. Minimum settlement amounts apply; please refer to Coinduck.com/docs/settlement for information related to minimum settlement amounts and deposit frequency. We will charge you the applicable wire fees, except when settling USD to a bank located in the US or when settling EUR to a bank within the SEPA zone.</p>

        <h5>8.3.2 Your Bank Account</h5>
        <p>You must provide us with written notice at least one (1) business day prior to closing your bank account. If you wish to continue to receive direct deposits, you must provide us with information for a substitute bank account. You are solely liable for all fees and costs associated with your bank account and for all overdrafts. You are also liable to us for any fees that we may incur based on your provision of inaccurate information or instructions. You authorize us to initiate electronic credits to your bank account at any time, as necessary to process your transactions. We will not be liable for any delays in receipt of funds or errors in bank account entries caused by third parties.</p>

        <h5>8.3.3 Settlements in a Supported Cryptocurrency</h5>
        <p>Any supported cryptocurrency accepted by Coinduck on your behalf must be settled to a cryptocurrency wallet that you provided. Payments in any of the supported cryptocurrencies are sent to your designated wallet address, at least once per calendar day. Coinduck is not liable for any losses incurred as a result of improperly reported or designated wallet addresses that you provide.</p>

        <h5>8.3.4 Refund Reserve</h5>
        <p>With your explicit consent, Coinduck can set a refund reserve. You can use the refund reserve to refund Coinduck invoices (e.g. when goods/services are not delivered) or to fund cryptocurrency payout requests. Once the refund reserve has been set, Coinduck does not settle the refund reserve amount. Pending refunds are deducted from your refund reserve. Pending refunds are deducted from the settlement amount if your refund reserve is zero (just like a refund reserve does).</p>

        <h5>8.3.5 Settlement Minimum</h5>
        <p>Coinduck settles once the settlement amount is above the settlement minimum. Merchants that are on the Starter Plan only receive a settlement once a week if the settlement amount is above the settlement minimum.</p>

        <h4>8.4 Payment Exceptions</h4>
        <p>In certain situations when an invoice is not fully paid or overpaid, it will result in a payment exception. You can resolve payment exceptions from the Coinduck merchant dashboard.</p>

        <p>Coinduck incurs miner fees to refund a payment. If the Purchaser requests a refund for a Payment Exception, Coinduck will deduct the miner fees from the refund amount.</p>

        <h5>8.4.1 Underpayments</h5>
        <p>Underpayments occur when the Purchaser sends less than the full amount required to mark the invoice as fully paid. Since the invoice is not fully paid or complete, the funds do not get applied to the merchant ledger. Coinduck will send an email to the Purchaser allowing the Purchaser to request a refund for the partial payment. The Purchaser also has the ability to request a refund of the partial payment directly from the invoice. If you want to accept underpayments, you can enable this in your Coinduck merchant dashboard. In this case Coinduck will adjust the invoice price to the amount paid, instead of</p>
        <p>refunding the underpayment.</p>

        <h5>8.4.2 Overpayments</h5>
        <p>Overpayments occur when an invoice receives excess funds. In cases such as this, this invoice passes through the state of being paid in full and is marked as an overpayment. Once the invoice is status is “complete”, the funds to mark the invoice as fully paid are applied to the merchant ledger. However, the excess funds are not applied. Coinduck will send an email to the Purchaser allowing the Purchaser to request a refund for the excess funds. The Purchaser also has the ability to request a refund of the excess funds directly from the invoice.</p>

        <h5>8.4.3 Orphan Payment</h5>
        <p>Orphan Payments occur when a transaction is received outside the time window referenced in Section 8.1 (Invoice Generation and Exchange Rate Guarantee). Any payments sent to the expired address will show up in Coinduck’s system as an orphan payment. For more information or to resolve orphaned payments, either you or the Purchaser will need to reach out to our support team with the appropriate information.</p>

        <h5>8.4.4 Unsupported Payments</h5>
        <p>Unless explicitly mentioned on our website or in our Terms, we do not support or process payments for unsupported payments, coins, or blockchains (“UP”). Purchasers should not pay any Coinduck invoice or send UPs to a Coinduck address. Coinduck assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect to UPs. If a Purchaser transmits a UP, the Purchaser may lose any perceived value in the UP. Additionally, you and the Purchaser agree that Coinduck assumes no responsibility whatsoever in respect to that UP and you and the Purchaser will not be able to recover the UP from Coinduck.</p>

        <h4>8.5 Certain Deferrals</h4>
        <p>If we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Coinduck account, we may delay settlement or restrict access to your funds while we do so. Additionally, we may delay settlement or restrict access to your funds if required to do so by law, court order or at the request of law enforcement.</p>

        <h4>8.6 Account Information</h4>
        <p>You will have access to account information detailing your ledger and transaction and settlement history through your merchant account. Should you identify an error, you must notify us within thirty(30) calendar days of the ledger entry posting.</p>

        <h3>9. Refunds and Adjustments</h3>
        <h4>9.1 Refund Procedures</h4>
        <p>Coinduck can facilitate crpytocurrency refunds on your behalf. You can decide to issue a partial refund or refund the full amount of the initial purchase. You can also decide whether to issue the refund denominated in your local currency or in a supported cryptocurrency. If you do not have enough funds in your Coinduck account to cover the refund, Coinduck may require you to deposit a cryptocurrency or fiat to Coinduck to cover the refund to the Purchaser. Any required currency conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot rate determined by Coinduck, following the guidelines found here: Coinduck.com/exchange-rates.</p>

        <h5>9.1.1 Refund of Payment Exceptions</h5>
        <p>If a payment exception is not refunded by you within 30 days after the invoice creation date, you will only be able to refund (and not accept) the payment exception and Coinduck will lock the applicable cryptocurrency/USD exchange rate exactly 30 days after the date and time of invoice creation.</p>

        <p>For any refunds of payment exceptions that occur after the 30-day window, the locked exchange rate is used to determine the amount of cryptocurrency that will be refunded. The cryptocurrency balance is converted to USD on the 30th day at midnight UTC. Additionally, because of the cryptocurrency price fluctuations, Coinduck will only refund the cryptocurrency amount sent to Coinduck or the USD value, whichever is less. Any refunds of payment exceptions that happen prior to this 30-day window will be refunded in the exact amount of cryptocurrency originally received.</p>

        <p>*Example for BTC (same applies to other supported cryptocurrencies) if BTC price is lower after the 30th day:</p>

        <h6>Day BTC Paid BTC Price to USD BTC Refund Amount USD Value of Refund</h6>
        <table>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>$1000</td><td>1</td><td>$1000</td></tr>
            <tr><td>30</td><td>1</td><td>$900</td><td>1</td><td>$900</td></tr>
            <tr><td>31</td><td>1</td><td>$800</td><td>1</td><td>$800</td></tr>
            <tr><td>60</td><td>1</td><td>$450</td><td>1</td><td>$450</td></tr>
        </table>
        <br />

        <p>*Example for BTC (same applies to other supported cryptocurrencies) if BTC price is higher after the 30th day:<br />
        Day BTC Paid BTC Price to USD BTC Refund Amount USD Value of Refund</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>$500</td><td>1</td><td>$500</td></tr>
            <tr><td>30</td><td>1</td><td>$1,000</td><td>1</td><td>$1,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td>31</td><td>1</td><td>$2,000</td><td>0.5</td><td>$1,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td>60</td><td>1</td><td>$4,000</td><td>0.25</td><td>$1,000</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h4>9.2 Disclosure of Your Refund Policy</h4>
        <p>Coinduck is not responsible for Merchant refund policies. We do suggest Merchants have a clear refund policy for their customers (including, if applicable, “no refunds are allowed as all sales are final”). For certain industries, a refund policy may not be applicable (e.g. where a service is provided). If refunds are permitted, we recommend you to refund the amount of the initial purchase in the currency in which the item was priced.</p>

        <h4>9.3 Purchaser Complaints</h4>
        <p>Purchasers filing complaints with Coinduck about a purchase will be forwarded to you for resolution. Coinduck reserves the right to terminate accounts which receive excessive complaints.</p>

        <h4>9.4 Merchant Complaints</h4>
        <p>Merchants filing complaints regarding our processing service should complaints via email, phone or mail at support@Coinduckpayments.com, or 866.502.4831, respectively.</p>

        <h2>What kind of personal data do we collect?</h2>
        <p>The Personal Data we collect depends on the type of user:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Visitors: We may collect the following Personal Data for visitors of our websites (https://www.coinduck.kr,):
